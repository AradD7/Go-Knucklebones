# Silly Mini Games - Knucklebones
This is the backend of [Silly Mini Game](https://www.sillyminigames.com) written in Go with Postgres as database. Silly mini games is gamehub to play fun, simple and lesser known mini games with your friends! Currently only the game of Knucklebones is available but there is more to come!
## Motivation
I wanted to play knucklebones with my friends! The video game Cult of the Lamb had no online option and I could not find a to play this game with my friends. Although currently Silly Mini Games supports Knucklebones, but all of the non game logic code could be used to build different games which is what I intend do in the future.
